# Flappy-Bird-Demo

## About

This was my second coding project I ever completed. It was completed around February of 2018. This was my first introduction to the python programming language; I implemented a couple of scripts and used some standard Unity packages along with an excellent tutorial to get this thing published.

## Usage

Before anything, head over to the [Unity Website](https://unity.com/) and get yourself set up with an account. Download their Unity Hub and install the version best recommended for your machine. If you're interested in following through the tutorial which I completed, [Check out the Tutorial on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O865wMMxFm8) Unity hub offers many more tutorials which are just as interesting and valuable, the "Flappy Bird" demo in my opinion is an excellent one for those looking to learn python and OOP. The video game demo is built using core Unity game packages, and some minor customary scripting. Unity uses C##, but python is also acceptable. Regardless of skill level, this tutorial is beginner friendly and anyone with a passion for programming will be able to grasp what is being done, and how to replicate it.

# Conclusion
If you follow the tutorial linked above, you'll have your own "Flappy Bird" demo to share with friends. In the future, I'd love to revisit this project and add some more custom art. Maybe changing the dynamic of this game could turn it into a much more original piece of work. Officially speaking, this is a deprecated project and I'm not adding updates nor am I planning to.
